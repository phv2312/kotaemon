### File upload

In order for a file to be used as an index for retrieval, it must be processed by the
application first. Do this uploading your file to the UI and then select `Upload and Index`.

The application will take some time to process the file and show a message once it is
done. Then you will be able to select it in the [File index section](#file-index) of the [Chat tab](#chat-tab).

### File list

This section shows the list of files that have been uploaded to the application and
allows users to delete them.
